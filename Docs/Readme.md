# **PROJECT - USER TASK APPLICATION**

## **INTRODUCTION**
 It is a basic react web application in which user can create an account and own tasks like a "Task Manager".

## **About**
This is an application in which user can create own tasks and perform CRUD operations. User can also mark/unmark tasks. I have used ReactJs, NodeJs and MongoDB to make this application presentable.

Some of the following modules & functionality that I have used in this project are:
#### *Backend* 
- express : To make this app easier to build and faster.
- cors : For resource sharing and security purpose.
- jsonwebtoken : For Authentication, Authorization, Security, and Information exchange. 
- express-validator : For validations 
- dotenv : For hiding private data
- body-parser : To access the body input on the req object.
- bcryptjs : For password encryption 
- Error handler to catch errors.

#### *Frontend*
 - axios : For sending HTTP requests and managing response. 
 - materialize-css : To make application responsive and presentable.
 - react-toastify : For notifications
 - react-router-dom : For navigating b/w components ,changing the browser URL,  modifying the browser history, and keeping the UI state in sync.
 - react-modal : As a message box to display on the top of the screen.
 - react-datepicker : To pick date 
 - React context : To share data b/w components.
 - For state management I have used React-reducer and React-state.



## **WEBSITE ARCHITECTURE**

### **Frontend**

#### *React Js* 
   React. js is an open-source JavaScript library that is used for building user interfaces specifically for single-page applications. It's used for handling the view layer for web and mobile apps. React also allows us to create reusable UI components.

### **Backend**

#### *Node JS*   
   Node.js is an open source, cross-platform runtime environment for developing server-side and networking applications. Node.js applications are written in JavaScript, and can be run within the Node.js runtime on OS X, Microsoft Windows, and Linux.

   Following are the areas where Node.js is is extensively used:

   - I/O bound Applications
   - Data Streaming Applications
   - Real-time Applications
   - JSON APIs based Applications
   - Single Page Applications

### **Database**

#### *Mongo DB*   

   MongoDB is a cross-platform document-oriented database program. It is a NoSQL database program, MongoDB uses JSON-like documents with optional schemas.

   Features:

   - The most natural and productive way to work with data.
   - Supports arrays and nested objects as values.
   - Allows for flexible and dynamic schemas.
   - Rich and expressive query language that allows you to filter and sort by any field, no matter how nested it may be
     within a document.

### **API**

   REST api's will be used as they are very fast and stateless protocol based
