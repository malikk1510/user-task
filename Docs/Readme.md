### **Frontend**

#### *React Js* 
   React. js is an open-source JavaScript library that is used for building user interfaces specifically for single-page applications. It's used for handling the view layer for web and mobile apps. React also allows us to create reusable UI components.

### **Backend**

#### *Node JS*

   Following are the areas where Node.js is is extensively used:

   - I/O bound Applications
   - Data Streaming Applications
   - Real-time Applications
   - JSON APIs based Applications
   - Single Page Applications

### **Database**

#### *Mongo DB*   

   MongoDB is a cross-platform document-oriented database program. It is a NoSQL database program, MongoDB uses JSON-like documents with optional schemas.

   Features:

   - The most natural and productive way to work with data.
   - Supports arrays and nested objects as values.

     within a document.
